# BubbleMaster
BubbleMaster is an accelerometer-based Android game in which you 'roll' a bubble on your screen by tilting your phone. The current player's fastest time gets saved in a Firebase Database. There are currently 3 different levels, each possessing 3 difficulty levels.


Upcoming plans for improvement:
- Add login functionality to Firebase, so that each player may have their own account and best times
- Change refresh process to reduce lag when loading a level and rolling the bubble
- Change obstacle placement/collision process for cleaner level creation and playing
- Change level background creation process
- Clean up the UI to make the game sleeker
